Notes on running the assessment for JS-All, March 2019, London CYF

What is this assessment?
===========================
A simple summative assessment for after the CYF javascript modules, taking under an hour.
Questions are by Sanyia and Luciano at CYF London.

MENTOR NOTES: 
===========================

* TIMING: London ran this in 40 minutes, including gist submissions. (11:10 - 11:50)
    * Very few students attempted all the questions in that time, but we didn't want to subject them to a longer assessment.
* Get everyone sat down with their laptops
* Announce the intro while they're setting up but make sure everyone understands
* Announce the rules/guidance verbally (there are very few)
* Post the link to the questions (see rules section)
* Record student attendance, start and stop times, and their gist urls, in a spreadsheet.  
* * Here is an example: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1drsRoE8AcpbSmt16d9NdgcnoIEfHIYhP_jGXH4NVr0k/edit?usp=sharing
* Feed back to make the assessment better for next the class.

Helping the students:

* If someone is completely stuck because they've e.g. got mismatching brackets in one function, it's fine to recover them, and make a note in the spreadsheet.
* However, don't help the students with question interpretation or problem solving.  If they're stuck, tell the student to work on the next question, but tell your assessment leader about any issues (and record it in the spreadsheet)

Intro: (to avoid anxiety) (announced verbally):
===========================
* You CANNOT fail this quiz!  There is no "passing" or "failing".
* It's for the mentors to know what they need to improve in the teaching.

* We have 40 minutes, including submission using gist

Rules (announced verbally):
===========================
* Log in to github
* You CAN use MDN to check for syntax: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference
* But otherwise don't use the web.
* The link will now be posted on your student slack channel: 
https://gist.githubusercontent.com/nbogie/a86abbc9c6d0bed559e1b9ccadda809f/raw/cfa21907b80843eee7e920f9981148defb3e3bff/jsquiz.js
* Copy and paste the text of the gist into a new vscode file
* Save it, with your name in the filename: e.g. maria.js or alan.js

* When instructed at the end of the quiz: 
    1. log in to github.com
    2. copy paste your work as a new "secret" gist at https://gist.github.com/
    3. post the URL in the student slack channel

Tips for students (announced verbally):
=======================================
* It's FINE if you don't know or can't remember something.
* If you have problems with a question and for more than a few minutes you cannot progress, then move on.
* Keep running the file in node after every save.
* You may want to call the functions you write, to test them.
*      e.g.
*      console.log(question1(3, 26))

Debrief (announced verbally)
===========================
* THANK YOU!
* DON'T WORRY - you can't fail this! It's for us to use to improve our teaching.
* Question to class: Why didn't I announce this? Why did I surprise you?
* Answer:            I didn't want anyone losing sleep worrying!


After the exam:
===============
* Make sure you have a collected a valid gist for all participating students
* Coordinate with any absent students to attempt the quiz at home under the same rules
* Neill has made some scripts to download all gists, and collate the responses by question.
