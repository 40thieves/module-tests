# JS Modules tests

This exam will allow us - and also yourself - to evaludate your current knowledge about javascript programming. No pressure, you won't get a rate for this exam.

Your code will be evaluated, reviewed and you will receive a feedback from a mentor about where you've done right and where you should improve.

Please do not cheat and do not slack/chat with your colleagues.

You may not use Google or StackOverFlow to find solutions and always try to do it yourself first
We suggest you to only use the Javascript documentation from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide).

## Goals

* Read carefully all the code, all comments as well as the unit tests to understand what the code is supposed to do
* Fill in the parts marked with TODO

**Bonus:** if you're done before the end of the granted time, you can try to modify your code to use the [ES6 syntax](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/).

## Install

Fork and clone this repository to your computer and install the packages with `npm` or `yarn`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/codeyourfuture/module-tests.git
cd module-tests
npm install
```

## Run the unit tests

You can run the following command to run the unit tests:

```sh
npm test
```

To run and watch:

```sh
npm test -- --watch
```

## Submit your solution

Don't forget to commit your code often. Once it's ready, create a pull request with your solution.

Commits done after the time is up won't be considered.
